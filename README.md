# polymer_db

# Instructions for Darina:

The first task for this project is to create a script that is able to enumerate all folders within a folder and store them in a list (or array) in Python. 
To do so, you can use the folder **polymers** that contains the subfolders **pol_combination_XXX**. Then, the second task is using that list (or array) 
to randomly select 50 folders. Once the script is working, we can start to use ORCA and perform some **DFT** calculations (I hope this is the task for next 
week). If you have any question, please slack me!




This repository stores a polymer database with a corresponding analysis of the quantities which have been computed using the *ab-initio* quantum mechanical 
program ORCA. The workplan and the suggested activities are described in the document **Polymers.pdf**. The next list explains the contents found in every 
folder.

1. **bilbiography:** Contains a relevant selection of articles and documents introducing the basic concepts to understand and analyze polymers. 

2. **orca:** Stores input files with simple examples to perform geometry optimization calculations for 

3. **polymers:** Contains a set of 111 selected structures which will be used to test the software development required for this project.
