# polymer_db

# Description repository

This repository stores a polymer database with a corresponding analysis of the quantities which have been computed using the *ab-initio* (quantum mechanical)
program ORCA. The workplan and the suggested activities are described in the document **WP_KURF_2023.pdf** within the **bibliography** folder. The next list explains 
the contents found in every folder.

1. **bilbiography:** Contains an introductory document explaining the topic of polymers and the roadmap of the project. 

2. **orca:** Stores input files with simple examples to perform geometry optimization calculations for polymers (legacy). This is not needed for **KURF_2023**.

3. **polymers:** Contains a set of 111 selected structures which will be used to test the software development required for this project. Also, it contains the
    python code *orca_elec_prop.py* which extracts the relevant information from quantum-mechanical calculations performed with ORCA.
