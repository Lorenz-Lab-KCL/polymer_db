# polymer_db

This repository stores a polymer database with a corresponding analysis of the quantities which have been computed using the *ab-initio* quantum mechanical 
program ORCA. The workplan and the suggested activities are described in the document **Polymers.pdf**. The next list explains the contents found in every 
folder.

1. **bilbiography:** Contains a relevant selection of articles and documents introducing the basic concepts to understand and analyze polymers. 

2. **orca:** Stores input files with simple examples to perform geometry optimization calculations for 

3. **polymers:** Contains a set of 50 selected structures which will be used to test the software development required for this project.
